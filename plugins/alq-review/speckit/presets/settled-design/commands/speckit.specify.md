## Premise answers and root cause

The last line of the arguments names a premise report. Read it before writing the spec.

- Fill `## Why this is worth doing` from the report's answers and sources, as they are written there.
- When the report says `Reports wrong behaviour: yes`, trace the behaviour through the code and write
  `## Root cause` as the spec template directs. When it says `no`, the section is the one line the template
  gives for that case.
